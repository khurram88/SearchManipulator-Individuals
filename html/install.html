<h1>Welcome to SearchManipulator DIY Application.</h1>

<p>Click on the smaller fox icon above the big fox in the top right of your screen. This screen will memorize your data and apply it to the necessary social media websites, while providing the technical aspects of SEO (search engine optimization) to ensure they rank highly on search results.</p>

<p>1) Start with Set 1. Wait at least two weeks from completion of Set 1 before running Set 2. The reason for this is if you create too many sites too quickly, Google can catch on.</p>

<!-- <p>Make sure to have at least four biographies added in the main menu. Professionally written biographies can be purchased from <a href="http://www.searchmanipulator.com/">SearchManipulator.com</a>, or you can provide your own. The biographies should speak about yourself in the 3rd person and be 250-300 words each. The four biographies will all say similar things, but with different word choices and phrasing.</p>-->

<p>2) Please type your information into every data field in the main menu. Use the name you are targeting. If the negative website shows up for “Jon” then do not use “Jonathan”. Leave your middle name blank if you are not targeting it. Click on the "?" icon for more of a description on each field.</p>

<p> Make sure to have at least four biographies added in the main menu for EACH set you run. However, more biographies you provide the better. They should speak about you in the 3rd person and be 200-300 words each. The biographies need to be brand new to the internet; do not copy and paste your company profile, for example. A typical biography will read like your resume but in paragraph form. They will all saying similar things, but with different word choices and phrasing. Or if you prefer, you can have some or all biographies focus on a different facet of your life. </p>

<p> Professionally written biographies can be purchased from <a href="http://www.searchmanipulator.com/">SearchManipulator.com</a>, or you can provide your own. </p>

<p>3) When adding URLs to the “Link 1-3” option at the bottom, select URLs that are directly below the negative website on search results. For example, if you have a LinkedIn page directly below the negative website on Google search results, you will want to add it to the main menu, so the software can promote it to out-rank the negative website. But, if your LinkedIn out-ranks all negative websites, then there is no reason to promote it so do not add it.</p>

<p>4) Click "SAVE" at the top of the menu. This will save your information so you don't have to re-type it.</p>

<p>5) Click "GO" at the top of the menu. Work from left to right on the tabs. Look for instructions whenever you see the fox logo.</p>

<p>6) It is recommended to buy a domain name after this, www.YourName.com, for example. We recommend using GoDaddy.com to set up your personal domain, as they are the easiest to use. The software will help get you started through our affiliate program, and apply a big coupon to save you money. It will be less than $2 a month to run it through them.
